## Sections

Several different sections are supported.

### Contributors

If an `.all-contributorsrc` is present, add a **Contributors** section and link to their respective GitHub profiles.

### Custom sections

For every extra json file passed, add a section listing the names mentioned.

For example, to add a `## Testers`, section, create a file `testers.json`:

```json
[{ "name": "A robot" }, { "name": "Beep Boop" }]
```

and pass it like this:

```bash
$ npx credit-roll ./testers.json > credits.md
```

The resulting markdown will be:

    ...
    ## Testers

      - A robot
      - Beep Boop
    ...

The section name is deducted from the file name.

### Libraries

For each library found in `./node_modules`, add name, license name and license text.

## Example

Below is the `credit-roll` output for this project (only production dependencies, for brevity). Check [credits.md](https://github.com/libscie/credit-roll/blob/main/credits.md) for a full example.
